I have always wanted to start my own code, write down new stuffs I learned before I forget them. Thought about writing my own blog site in rails, but changed my mind after I find Jekyll. It does what I need, it is easy to maintain and I can host it on github for free! Awesome!

Now let the fun begin! Things I want to write about:

* new techniques

* solution for problem I encountered

* new tools
